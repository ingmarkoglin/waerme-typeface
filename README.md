waerme Typeface

During my graphic design studies in Kreuzberg I developed a typeface. The headline font ‘wærme’ follows a form grid out of strong geometrics in contrast with vivid shapes.

Give it a shot! I’m contributing my typeface ‘waerme’ – download it here for free!﻿ It’s for your private- and commercial use, licensed under Creative Commons (CC). I’m very excited if you can find a use for it in your own or clients’ projects and I’d love to see what it would actually look like. Also please feel invited to pull for possible remakes (e.g. building additional font glyphs, weights or a variable font version) and contribute back to github. That would be highly appreciated. Thanks and enjoy!
